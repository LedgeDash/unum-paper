\abstract
% Workflow systems have emerged to meet the demands of large serverless
% applications by providing high-level interfaces for workflow definition, rich
% semantics for function composition and strong guarantees for workflow
% execution.

Workflow systems have emerged to meet the demands of large-scale serverless
applications with higher-level programming interfaces, rich composition
semantics and strong execution guarantees. However, current designs rely on
supplemental hosted orchestrators to execute workflows and thus break out of
the serverless abstraction, compromising key serverless benefits such as fast
autoscaling, fine-grained billing and efficient resource multiplexing.

This paper presents \name{}, a new design for serverless workflow systems that
supports existing higher-level interfaces while executes purely as serverless
functions. \name{} uses a two-stage compiler that distributes orchestration
logic to constituent functions at compile-time and removes the need for
orchestrators during runtime. \name{} uses checkpoints with strongly
consistent data stores to prevent re-executions and provide strong execution
guarantees.

We present and evaluate an implementation of \name{} that can compile Step
Functions state machines and execute them purely as Lambda functions with
either S3 or DynamoDB as the data store. Our comparison with Step Functions
shows that applications scale up to 4.58x faster and costs more than one
order-of-magnitude less when running with \name{}.
