\gg~\cite{gg-atc} proposed thunk. But to run applications in gg, you need a custom
compiler for each application. name{} provides a set of APIs and a compiler
for the Python programming language.

% \name{} should stand without gg. The core contribution is not caching results.
% It is a higher-level interface that simplies writing FaaS applications. We
% could use \gg IR to get caching, but result caching is \gg's contribution, not
% ours. In practice, this means that \gg can appear in the Implementation
% section but should not appear in Design.

CloudBurst.
