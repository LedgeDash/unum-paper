Tasks communicate with the coordinator through
the remote procedure calls (RPCs) summarized in Table 2

1. Orthogonal: They focus on building a data store with specialized APIs and consistency models for faas workflow
2. Differennt programming interface (TODO: more details)
3. Not built on real faas platform; can't run on aws, azure or google cloud
