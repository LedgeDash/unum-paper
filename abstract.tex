Serverless workflow systems have emerged to meet the demands of large-scale
serverless applications, offering high-level programming interfaces, rich
composition semantics and strong execution guarantees that enable applications
with 10s or 100s of functions and complex interactions. However, current
designs rely on centralized orchestrators that require additional engineering,
and resources, and can undermine the cost and scalability advantages of
serverless.

This paper presents Unum, a \emph{decentralized} serverless workflow
system. Unum partitions workflows written in high-level languages at
compile-time, and executes orchestration logic in-situ with user functions in
a decentralized manner. Unum can run on a minimal serverless infrastructure
while provides strong execution guarantees, performances and costs similar or
better than existing centralized workflow systems.

We present an implementation of Unum that supports a superset of
applications expressible using AWS Step Functions, while runs up to 4.58x
faster, and costs over an order-of-magnitude less.
