Standalone serverless orchestrators simplify the developement of complex
serverless applications but limit application flexibility and are expensive to
use. We argue that these additional orchestration services are unnecessary.
Instead, application-level orchestration, deployed as a library, can support
the same patterns and execution guarantees as existing standalone
orchestrators, using only basic serverless components that are already used by
applications and universally supported by cloud providers---a scalable
``Function'' executor (FaaS) and a consistent datastore.

% To demonstrate this, we describe the design and implementation of \name{}, a
% decentralized, application-level serverless workflow system. \name{} compiles
% workflows written in existing high-level workflow languages into a partitioned
% orchestration library that executes orchestration logic in-situ with user
% functions. 

To demonstrate this, we present \name{}, an application-level serverless
workflow system. \name{} provides orchestration as a library that runs in-situ
with user-defined FaaS functions. Without a standalone service, \name{}
introduces an intermediate language to partition high-level application logic
and leverages strongly consistent data stores to coordinate and ensure
correctness in a decentralized manner.

\name{} provides the same strong execution guarantees, performs better, and
costs significantly less than existing standalone orchestrators. Compared with
a state-of-the-art standalone orchestrator, AWS Step Functions, \name{} grants
applications greater flexibility to employ application-specific patterns and
optimizations, runs as much as 2x faster and up to 9x cheaper for a
representative set of applications.
