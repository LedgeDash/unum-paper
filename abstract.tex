Server workflow systems have emerged to meet the demands of large-scale
serverless applications, offering high-level programming interfaces, rich
composition semantics and strong execution guarantees that enable applications
with 10s or 100s of functions and complex interactions. However, current
designs rely on centralized orchestrators that require additional engineering,
and resources, and can undermine the cost and scalability advantages of
serverless.

This paper presents \name{}, a \emph{decentralized} serverless workflow
system. \name{} partitions workflows written in high-level languages at
compile-time, and executes orchestration logic in-situ with user functions in
a decentralized manner. \name{} can run a minimal serverless infrastructure
services while provides strong execution guarantees, performance and cost
similar or better to existing centralized workflow systems.

We show that \name{} can support a superset of applications expressible using
AWS Step Functions, while run up to 4.58x faster, and cost over an
order-of-magnitude less when running with \name{}.
