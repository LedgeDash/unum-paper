Server workflow systems have emerged to meet the demands of large-scale
serverless applications. High-level programming interfaces, rich composition
semantics and strong execution guarantees enable applications with 10s or 100s
of functions and complex interactions. However, current designs rely on
centralized orchestrators that require addition engineering, maintenance and
resources, and serve as an additional bottleneck for scalability and
performance.

This paper presents \name{}, a \emph{decentralized} serverless workflow system.
In \name{}, a two-stage compiler distributes high-level orchestration logic to
constituent functions at compile-time.  This allows workflows to execute using
only minimal serverless infrastructure services.
\name{} provides strong execution guarantees and has performance and cost similar or better to existing centralized workflow systems.
and minimizes re-executions under faults.

We show that \name{} can support a superset of applications expressible using
AWS's Step Functions, run up to 4.58x faster, and cost signficantly less when
running with \name{}.
