Standalone orchestrators simplify the development of serverless applications
by providing higher-level programming interfaces, coordinating function
interactions and ensuring exactly-once execution. However, they limit
application flexibility and are expensive to use. We show that these
specialized orchestration services are unnecessary. Instead, application-level
orchestration, deployed as a library, can support the same programming
interfaces, complex interactions and execution guarantees, utilizing only
basic serverless components that are already universally supported and billed
at a fine-grained per-use basis. Furthermore, application-level orchestration
affords applications more flexibility and reduces costs for both providers and
users.

To demonstrate this, we present \name{}, an application-level serverless
orchestration system. \name{} introduces an intermediate representation that
partitions higher-level application definitions at compile-time and provides
orchestration as a runtime library that executes in-situ with user-defined
FaaS functions. On unmodified serverless infrastructures, \name{} functions
coordinate and ensure correctness in a decentralized manner by leveraging
strongly consistent data stores.

Compared with AWS Step Functions, a state-of-the-art standalone orchestrator,
our evaluation shows that \name{} performs well, costs significantly less and
grants applications greater flexibility to employ application-specific
patterns and optimizations. For a representative set of applications, \name{}
runs as much as 2x faster and costs 9x cheaper.
