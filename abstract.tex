\majoredits{Standalone serverless orchestrators simplify the developement of
 complex serverless applications but limit application flexibility and are
 expensive to use. We argue that these additional orchestration services are
 unnecessary. \secondedits{Instead, application-level orchestration, deployed
 as a library, affords applications more flexibility and reduces costs for
 both providers and users. Moreover, such an orchestration library can
 support the same execution guarantees and complex patterns as existing
 standalone orchestrators, utilizing only basic serverless components that are
 already used by applications and universally supported by cloud providers
 without needing additional specialized APIs.}

To demonstrate this, we present \name{}, an application-level serverless
workflow system. \name{} provides orchestration as a library that runs in-situ
with user-defined FaaS functions. Without a standalone service, \name{}
introduces an intermediate language to partition high-level application logic
and leverages strongly consistent data stores to coordinate and ensure
correctness in a decentralized manner.

\name{} provides the same strong execution guarantees, performs well, and
costs significantly less compared with existing standalone orchestrators.
Compared with a state-of-the-art standalone orchestrator, AWS Step Functions,
\name{} grants applications greater flexibility to employ application-specific
patterns and optimizations, runs as much as 2x faster and up to 9x cheaper for
a representative set of applications.}
