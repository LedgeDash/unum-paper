Workflow systems  have emerged to meet the demands of large-scale serverless
applications with higher-level programming interfaces, rich composition
semantics and strong execution guarantees. However, current designs rely on
%supplemental hosted
centralized orchestrators to execute workflows and thus break out of
the serverless abstraction, compromising key serverless benefits such as fast
auto-scaling, fine-grained billing and efficient resource multiplexing.

This paper presents \name{}, a new design for serverless workflow systems.
In \name{}, a two-stage compiler distributes high-level orchestration
logic to constituent functions at compile-time.
This removes the need for orchestrators at runtime, which allows workflows to
execute purely as serverless functions.
By checkpointing progress to a strongly consistent data store
of choice, \name{} provides strong execution guarantees
and minimizes re-executions under faults.

We present and evaluate an implementation of \name{} that can compile Step
Functions state machines and execute them purely as Lambda functions with
either S3 or DynamoDB as the data store. Our comparison with Step Functions
shows that applications scale up to 4.58x faster and cost more than one
order-of-magnitude less when running with \name{}.
