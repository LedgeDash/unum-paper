\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Serverless platforms allow developers to construct applications from modular
programming units that can scale quickly and independently, promising
burst-scalability and fine-grained billing. Workflow orchestrators make building
complex applications out of these event-driven, asynchronous functions
reasonable, but may introduce performance, cost, scalability, and deployment
overhead to developers and platform providers. We designed and implemented
\name{}, a \emph{decentralized} workflow orchestrator that requires no
additional infrastructure to deploy, imposes no additional limits on
scalability, and performs as well as or better than centralized solutions while
providing similar expressiveness and execution guarnatees.
